    "### Background\n",
    "Enzymes catalyze many medically important reactions in biology. We are often interested in knowing which enzymes catalyze which reactions, because this can help us map metabolic pathways and understand what happens when they are perturbed by genetic mutations, malignant transformation, or toxins. \n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing which enzymes do what is only part of enzymology. It's also useful to know how good they are at their jobs. How fast do they work, and how specific are they? Can they work on only one substrate, or lots of different substrates? Can they be stopped or inhibited? Quantitative enzymology is the study of these questions. In this field, we use mathematical models to describe enzyme speed and efficiency. In order to undestand these models, we must start with a general form of and enzymatic reaction. \n",

    "Many enzymes follow the general reaction above. First, they bind to a substrate ($S$) and form an enzyme-substrate complex ($ES$). This step is usually considered revserible. Then, catalysis occurrs, converting the substrate ($S$) to product ($P$). The enzyme releases the product, and then it is a free enzyme again ($E$), ready to accept another substrate. The rate constants that describe each step are as follows:\n",

Under certain conditions--when $k_2$ is negligible compared to $k_{-1}$--$K_M$ approxmates $K_D$, which is a measure of affinity. $K_M$ is thus often considered a measure of the strength of an enzyme's affinity for substrate (the strength of substrate binding).
